# Playground for CSS Specificity

I created this project as a part of a lecture I'm going to pass in my work.

I got the inspiration from the following links:

[Specifics on CSS Specificity](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/)

[CSS Specificity explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0kfcP_nD9E)

[Specificity Calculator](https://specificity.keegan.st/)

[w3schools - CSS Specificity](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp)

[CSS Speicifity](http://cssspecificity.com/)

## Setup

`git clone` the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Slash7GNR/css-specificity-training.git
cd css-specificity-training
```
Then simply browse to the HTML files.
